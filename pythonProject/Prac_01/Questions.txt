	Logic Exercise

From these deductions, we can conclude:

Brown is the project manager.
Jones is the consultant.
Smith is the programmer.

	Algorithm with IPO (Input, Processing, Output):


# Input
dose = float(input("Enter the dose (in grams): "))
yield_ = float(input("Enter the yield (in grams): "))

# Processing
brew_ratio = dose / yield_

# Output
print(f"The brew ratio is {brew_ratio:.2f}")


	Algorithm with Decision:

# Input
item_price = float(input("Enter the price of the item: "))
money_in_pocket = float(input("Enter the money you have in your pocket: "))

# Decision
if item_price <= money_in_pocket:
    print("You can afford to buy the item.")
else:
    print("You cannot afford to buy the item.")

	Algorithm with Repetition:

# Algorithm with Repetition
print("Start cleaning the room.")
while True:
    things_on_floor = int(input("Enter the number of things on the floor: "))
    if things_on_floor == 0:
        break
    print(f"Pick up one thing from the floor. {things_on_floor - 1} things left.")
print("End cleaning.")

	Problem Decomposition:



Problem 1: Drug Administration

Nouns: doctor, drug, patient, system, hourly dosage, number of hours, total
Verbs: calculate, administered, get, make, display.

	Algorithm:

1. Input hourly dosage and number of hours.
2. Calculate the total amount administered as hourly dosage multiplied by number of hours.
3. Display the total amount administered.

Problem 2: Booking Calculation

Nouns: Happy Photos, customer, booking, customer's name, date, booking id, hourly charge, number of hours, total charge, id code
Verbs: calculate, make, enter, display

	Algorithm:

1. Input customer's name, date, hourly charge, and number of hours.
2. Calculate the total charge.
3. Make a unique booking id using the customer's name and date.
4. Display the total charge and id code.

Problem 3: Road Trip Average Speed

Nouns: road trip planning system, user, distance, travel time, average speed
Verbs: ask, get, show

	Algorithm:

1. Ask the user for distance (in km) and travel time (in minutes).
2. Calculate the average speed as distance divided by travel time.
3. Show the average speed in km/hour.
