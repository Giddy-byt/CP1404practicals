 1. b + c * a > a ** b

b + c * a equals 3 + 4 * 2, which is 3 + 8, resulting in 11.
a ** b equals 2 ** 3, which is 8.
So, the expression becomes 11 > 8, which is True.
True or (c ** b - a % b > c ** c)

 2. c ** b - a % b equals 4 ** 3 - 2 % 3, which is 64 - 2, resulting in 62.
c ** c equals 4 ** 4, which is 256.
The expression inside the parentheses becomes 62 > 256, which is False.
So, the expression becomes True or False, which is True.
not True and False or True

 3. not True is False.
False and False is False.
False or True is True.
(a * b + c) % 2 == 0

 4. (a * b + c) equals (2 * 3 + 4), which is 6 + 4, resulting in 10.
10 % 2 is 0.
So, the expression becomes 0 == 0, which is True.
