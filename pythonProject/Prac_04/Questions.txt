1. The PyCharm keyboard shortcut for commenting out a selection of code is typically Ctrl + / on Windows or Cmd + / on Mac.
   This shortcut comments out the selected lines or uncommented them if they are already commented.

2. The two kinds of loops available in Python are "for" loops and "while" loops.

3. A "sentinel" in the context of loops is a special value used to signal the end of input or processing. It acts as a
stopping condition for the loop. For example, in a program that reads numbers from the user until they enter a sentinel
 value like -1, the sentinel (-1) indicates that the user wants to stop entering numbers.

4. There is nothing technically wrong with the variable name "nothingWrong" in Python. However, it's generally recommended
to use lowercase letters and underscores for variable names following the Python naming conventions. So, a more
conventional name would be "nothing_wrong."

5. Augmented assignment operators in Python are shortcuts for performing an operation and assignment in a single step.
They include operators like +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=, and &=, among others.

                LOGIC EXERCISE
1. Start with one marble from the box labeled "Mixed." Since all labels are incorrect, it cannot be the Mixed box.

2. You now have three possibilities:

    If the marble is white, then the box labeled "Mixed" must contain only white marbles. So, the labels "White" and "Black"
 are swapped.
    If the marble is black, then the box labeled "Mixed" must contain only black marbles. So, the labels "White" and "Black"
 are swapped.
    If the marble is black, then the box labeled "Mixed" must contain one white and one black marble. So, the labels "Mixed"
 and "Black" are swapped.

3. Now, you know which box contains only one type of marble, and you have identified one of the other two boxes as well.
To determine the last box, simply inspect one marble from the remaining unopened box. This will tell you which label
corresponds to that box.

With this approach, you only need to inspect two marbles in total:

One from the box labeled "Mixed" to determine the nature of the mixed box (white or black).
One from either the "White" or "Black" labeled box (whichever you didn't open in step 2) to identify the last box.
This solution ensures that you can definitely determine the contents of all three boxes with just two marble inspections.

                Loop outputs
(a)
1. Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5

2. Output: 33 34 35 36 37 38

3. Output: 17 16 15 14 13 12

4. Output: 1 0

(b)

1. [1, 5, 9, 13]: range(1, 14, 4)

2. [3, 2, 1]: range(3, 0, -1)

3. [7, 4, 1, -2, -5]: range(7, -6, -3)

            Patterns
1. Error-checking user input, looping until they enter a valid response: Indefinite (while loop)

2. A menu with several options including 'quit': Definite (for loop)

3. Displaying all the months in a year: Definite (for loop)

4. Printing 5 random numbers: Definite (for loop)

5. Printing n random numbers, where n is a user input: Indefinite (while loop)
