                    Quick Questions
1. Main Difference Between List and Tuple:

Mutability: The main difference between a list and a tuple is that lists are mutable, meaning you can change
their contents (add, remove, or modify elements), while tuples are immutable, meaning once you create them,
you cannot change their contents.
Convention for Naming Lists:

2. In Python, lists are typically named using plural nouns to indicate that they can hold multiple items. For
 example, you might name a list that holds a collection of fruits as fruits.
Good Name for a List of Cities:

3. A good name for a list of cities could be city_names, cities, or something descriptive that conveys the
purpose of the list.
Number of Elements in a List:

4. Python lists can hold any number of elements, from an empty list (0 elements) to a list with millions of
elements. There's no fixed limit on the number of elements in a list.
True or False? Elements in a List Must All Be of the Same Type:

5. False. In Python, lists can contain elements of different types. For example, a list can contain a mix of
 integers, floats, strings, or even other lists. Python's flexibility with data types is one of its strengths.
Python's len Function:

6. Python's len() function is used to determine the length (number of elements) of an iterable object, such
 as a list, tuple, string, or dictionary. It returns the number of items in the object. You can use it with
 various types, including lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, sets, and more.

        List Expressions

  Lists Warmup:

1. numbers[0]: 10
2. numbers[-1]: 81
3. numbers[3]: 81
4. 20 in numbers: True
5. 1 in numbers: False
6. numbers[1] + numbers[2]: 60
7. len(numbers): 4

    Warmup (2):
 1. Change the first element of numbers to 1:
numbers[0] = 1

 2. Change the last element of numbers to 4:
 numbers[-1] = 4

  3. Check if 1 is an element of numbers:
 1 in numbers

  4. Print the second value in the list multiplied by 10:

print(numbers[1] * 10)
